Instructions for Running:
Create the Python Files:

Create generate_image.py, train_model.py, and requirements.txt using any text editor.
Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Generate Image: Run generate_image.py by entering a prompt when prompted:

bash
Copy
Edit
python generate_image.py
Fine-tuning Model (Optional): Run train_model.py to fine-tune the model with your custom dataset:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
Notes:
The code will check if a GPU is available and use it; otherwise, it defaults to using the CPU.
Fine-tuning: In train_model.py, replace the fine-tuning part with your specific method (this example assumes you're working with a dataset from Hugging Face). The load_dataset function is a placeholder, so you need to define how the dataset will be loaded, formatted, and used for training.
